# Advent of Code 2022 solutions
For this year, I decided to use [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022) to do more Rust practice. I decided to get a head start by learning how to do some of the more complex parsing tasks and data structures ahead of time, since it's a big struggle to learn those while also trying to solve the harder AoC puzzles. Those will go in [utils](./utils/), and there's a little module for trying things out in [testbed](./testbed/).

I'm keeping steps for quickly bootstrapping a solution in [setup](./docs/setup.md). I'll plan on keeping a running log of solutions and days here as well.
